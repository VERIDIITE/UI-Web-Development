# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT  - DUAL CHASE //

Welcome to my Portfolio Website.

My assignment required me to go through a portfolio root in order to demonstrate my abilities, which include programming, producer/engineer, and audio engineering. Since I make beats and songs for the public to hear and enjoy. I went to hell and back in order to demonstrate my dedication. It is my hope that my website will be a basic yet effective website where most of the pages will be responsive, so please keep your fingers crossed. the majority of my primary audience will be consumers who wish to purchase my beats.
I'll organise it such that there will be a primary index page for my work, with only a few details, until you arrive to my portfolio, where you will be able to watch my media player and listen to my beats, among other things.

I put the person's name as a source of inspiration in my reference list since he or she had an impact on my media player. As a result, it wasn't ideal. For some time, I've been interested in learning about how to make my own media player. Yes, I did the same thing.
I'm extremely happy with the results of my producer/programmer portfolio rollout. My goal was not to go over the top, but rather to produce something unique. This is a basic, but I enjoy it since it has a little flavour with it.

PROBLEMS / ERRORS.
For some reason, there were some issues with the media player, such as the fact that if you wanted to see the selection of beats, you couldn't since they were concealed for some reason, which was puzzling. But for the time being, you can just sit back and listen to the beats play the entire thing without interruption.
Last but not least, I used autocorrect to try to correct certain problems that I discovered on the first page of the document. Once those issues were resolved, I began using the W3 validator to check my code for errors. where I found a mistake that I hadn't seen before, and repaired it due to this validator, so it's much better this time around than it was before.

a list of errors that I encountered.
- CSS errors.
- Media player.
- IMG name errors.
- GITHUB, Merging errors.
- GITHIB MERGING INTO MASTER.
